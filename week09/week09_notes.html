        <h2>Chapter 9:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</li>
            <li>There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number of properties and methods that are supported by all the major browsers, making a sort of de facto standard. These properties and methods are made available through the window object. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.</li>
            <li>we introduced three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt(). These are not part of the ECMAScript standard, although all major browsers support them as methods of the window object.</li>
            <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box. The message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned.</li>
            <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel.</li>
            <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned.</li>
            <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</li>
            <li>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true, it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.
            The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter.</li>
            <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API.</li>
            <li>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code</li>
            <li>The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
            <li>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.</li>
            <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Chapter 4:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.</li>
            <li>Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any data- attributes it contains.</li>
            <li>he HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices.</li>
            <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.</li>
            <li>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:
                <ul>
                <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
                <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).</li>
                <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).</li>
                <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel. An example of this might be a search function that returns results based on your location. Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.</li>
            <li> Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript. The idea is that any processes that could take a long time are carried out in the background, so a website will continue to function without fear of the dreaded 'script has become unresponsive' message that occurs when a script runs for too long, shown below.</li>
            <li>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.</li>
            <li>The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.
            </li>
            <li>The audio and video elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
