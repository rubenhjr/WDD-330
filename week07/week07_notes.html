                <li>Functions have built-in properties such as length, but can have custom properties added.</li>
                <li>Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function, depending on certain conditions.</li>
                <li>A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.</li>
                <li>A callback is a function thatâ€™s provided as an argument to another function.</li>
                <li>Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop. This means that a program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for another task to be completed.</li>
                <li>Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.</li>
                <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.</li>
                <li>A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it was originally defined in.</li>
                <li>A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.</li>
                <li>A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.</li>
                <li>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as a series of functions.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Chpater 13</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</li>
                <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</li>
                <li>Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.</li>
                <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</li>
                <li>Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</li>
                <li>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create your own response objects.</li>
                <li>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
                <li>The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or response object.</li>
                <li>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</li>
                <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</li>
            </ul>
