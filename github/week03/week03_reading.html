        <h3> Object Methods:this</h3>
            <p>
                Object are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on.. <br>
                In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object. <br>
                A function can be copied between objects. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Chapter5:objects</h3>
            <p>
                To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket notation. Calling a method is the same as invoking a function, so parentheses need to be placed after the method name. <br>
                We can loop through all of an object’s properties and methods by using a for in loop. <br>
                It’s possible for an object to contain other objects. These are known as nested objects. <br>
                An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function. This is useful when there are a large number of parameters, as it allows the arguments to be provided by name and in any order. This means you don't have to remember the order to enter them when invoking a function. <br>
                Naming collisions occur when the same variable or function name is used for different purposes by code sharing the same scope.  <br>
                JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation that we have just seen. There are, however, a couple of key differences: Property names must be double-quoted, Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false, null, arrays and objects, Functions are not permitted values
            </p>
            <h3>Chapter6: Document Object Model</h3>
                <p>
                    The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled. <br>
                    Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes. <br>
                    An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute() method. <br>
                    The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM. <br>
                    The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.
                </p>
                <h3>Chapter7: Events</h3>
                <p>
                    Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to. <br>
                    Event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs. <br>
                    The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and methods relating to the event. <br>
                    There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events. <br>
                    Three events that occur when a user presses a key are:keydown, keypress and keyup. When a user presses a key, the events occur in that order. They are not tied to any particular key, although the information about which key was pressed is a property of the event object. <br>
                    Pressing the modifier keys such asShift,Ctrl,Alt and meta(Cmd on Mac) will fire the keydown and keyup events, but not the keypress event as they don't produce any characters on the screen. <br>
                    Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element. <br>
                    Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events that happen to its children elements.
