        <h3>Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
        <p class="chp8">
            The Form element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted. <br>
            Forms can be used a entering data into a browser.<br>
            Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different information. <br>
            Forms have focus, blur, and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form. <br>
            Using validation helps when you have a from that is looking for certain information. <br>
            HTML5 has its own validation API that can be used, although it lacks the full support from all browsers at the moment. <br>
            If the submit button is disabled then no action is taken when itâ€™s clicked. To do this action you need to add the disable attribute to the input element.<br>

        <h3>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>
            Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. <br>
            Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. <br>
            <b>Encapsulation:</b> In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality. <br>
            <b>Polymorphism:</b> In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation. <br>
            <b>Inheritance:</b> In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods. <br>
            <b>Classes:</b> Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known as class-based languages. This is because they use a class to define a blueprint for an object. <br>
            Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects. <br>
            All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype. <br>
            A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance chain. <br>
            Methods can be borrowed from other objects.

        <h3>Chapter 15: Modern Javascript</h3>
        <p>
            A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability. <br>
            Node.js had already implemented modules before they were introduced in ES6, and used a slightly different notation calledCommon JS modules. <br>
            A Common JS module is created in a separate file, and the module.exports method is used to make any functions available to other files. <br>
